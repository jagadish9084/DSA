LinkedList:-

Draw backs of Array over LinkedList:

  1. Array size is fixed. We must know the upper limit on the number of element in advance.
  2. Inserting an element in array is expensive as room has to be created for new element, to create room existing element have to shifted

Advantages of LinkedList over Array:

  1. Dynamic size
  2. Ease of insertion/deletion, because only link has to be changed to delete/insert an element in LinkedList
 
Drawbacks of LinkedList:

  1. Randow access is not allowed in linked list. We have to access element sequencially starting from the first node. So we can not binary      search with linked list.
  2. Extra memory space for the pointer is required with each element of the list.
